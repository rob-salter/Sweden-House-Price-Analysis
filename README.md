# Swedish-House-Price-Data

The project was started to scrape, clean and analyze house price data for the region of Västra Götaland in Sweden for a specific criteria. The inspiration for this project was to get a greater understanding of the housing market and understand basic metrics such as mean and median price differences, mean sale prices in target locations, temporal and spacial trends.

The criteria for the house price data is as follows:

    Västra Götalands Län
    Villa
    rooms min 3,5
    min final price 1,750,000kr
    max final price 4,000,000kr
    Last 12 months

The data was scraped from hemnet.se and resulted in 2181 datapoints from June 2019, June 2020. The data can be easily updated, and parameters changed to provide a broader dataset with minimal change to the code.
